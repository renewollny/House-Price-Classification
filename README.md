# House-Price-Classification
### MachineLearning-Project (Classification) from DataScience-Bootcamp

We're working for a consultancy specialized in real estate and received a dataset containing a historical register of housing prices in Ames, a small city in Iowa â€”the actual prices at which the properties were sold. For each house, it also contains around 80 different features, such as the area, the state of the property, whether it has a backyard or not, etc.

The task of the project is, to create a model to predict whether a house is expensive or not and then use this model on the test data.
